The setup.py file is provided to build setup from the given hello.py program file.

***Following is the procedure to make executables from python program***

1. setup.py is configured to run hellp.py and convert it into executable.
2. You must have cx_Freeze module installed in Python.
3. Run the following command to build executables
		
		python setup.py "COMMAND"

Standard commands:
  build            build everything needed to install
  build_py         "build" pure Python modules (copy to build directory)
  build_ext        build C/C++ extensions (compile/link to build directory)
  build_clib       build C/C++ libraries used by Python extensions
  build_scripts    "build" scripts (copy and fixup #! line)
  clean            clean up temporary files from 'build' command
  install          install everything from build directory
  install_lib      install all Python modules (extensions and pure Python)
  install_headers  install C/C++ header files
  install_scripts  install scripts (Python or otherwise)
  install_data     install data files
  sdist            create a source distribution (tarball, zip file, etc.)
  register         register the distribution with the Python package index
  bdist            create a built (binary) distribution
  bdist_dumb       create a "dumb" built distribution
  bdist_rpm        create an RPM distribution
  bdist_wininst    create an executable installer for MS Windows
  check            perform some checks on the package
  upload           upload binary package to PyPI

Extra commands:
  bdist_msi        create a Microsoft Installer (.msi) binary distribution
  build_exe        build executables from Python scripts
  install_exe      install executables built from Python scripts
